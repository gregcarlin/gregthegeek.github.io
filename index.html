                        During the summer of 2015 I worked for <a href="https://schoolbee.com">SchoolBee</a>. I was one of two developers and helped build the second iteration of their web platform. I developed an automated view system to improve the speeds of reads and built up other frontend and backend components of the website. Used Node.js, Express, Angularjs, MongoDB, Mongoose, MeanIO, and other related technologies.

                        I designed, built, maintained and enhanced <a href="http://mytrustco.com/"><strong>My Trust Co</strong></a>, a bespoke website dedicated to enabling individuals to organize trusts.
                        This project lasted several years and was organized by a local couple with me as the sole developer.

                        I created <strong>this website</strong> with an original design.

                        It allows programmers to work on projects without downloading git software. This is useful for situations in which one does not have admin access to a computer.
                        It also helps designers collaborate with programmers, as they can directly modify a project's files without having to learn git.
